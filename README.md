# BlinkLED-Arduino

This project uses an Arduino to blink an LED connected to digital pin 13.  
The LED turns on and off every 500 milliseconds.  
Useful for learning basic pin control and timing functions.
Since the LED is on board the Arduino, I cannot show a wiring diagram

## Hardware Used
- Arduino Uno
- Onboard LED

- 
## Code Overview
The `setup()` function configures pin 13 as an output.  
The `loop()` function toggles the LED on and off with a delay.
